This Archerys was Univeristy project.
The main base is: Three bowmen shoot a target. 
The first one shoots very fast but his aim is bad, 
the second one is the slowest shooter but his aim is the best,
the third one has a medium shoot rate but every time he shoot, he can have the same attributes from the first shooter or can have the same attributes from the second shooter.



The first version, all the arrows go to a limit in the x axis. 
The V2 version, all the arrows go to random spot in the radius target.


Both versions use Python as main language and use the Turtle library
