This project was a University project.

The code simulate people in a controlled environment.
The user must say how many people will be with the disease, 
how many people will be healthy, 
how long the disease will affect, 
how deadly the disease are and the probability to transfer the disease.

In the code, every second is a week, each person has a age and a birthday.
If the person complete 50 years, he will die.
If the total amount of people is under 300, each one have a 1 per cent chance to 'generate a child'.
If the person survive the disease, he will be imune for 52 weeks.
